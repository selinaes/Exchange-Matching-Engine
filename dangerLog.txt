1. The difference between session.save() and session.update(). If we save when supposed to update, there would be a
duplicate key error.

2. We used 'Hibernate' to map data tables to Java classes, and used interface like'CriteriaBuilder' to query from
database. The 'CriteriaBuilder' and 'CriteriaQuery' interfaces are quite new, and is only changed after Hibernate
5.3+. So at first we used criteriaBuilder.where() two times to query, but only the second sets of predicates worked.
Finally, we tried using only one criteriaBuilder.where() and it worked. Even though we repeated some code, we know
know that .where() will replace earlier predicates.
